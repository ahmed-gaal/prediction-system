This is the user interface for the model we created earlier to accurately 
predict the production of Sesame seed provided with the Area that has 
cultivated and the Yield expected from every hectare in tonnes.
The data used in the development of this web application has been obtained
from the public repository of the United Nation Food and Agriculture 
Organisation.
